<TR><TD>Because I will start a new job in March, I can't maintain these 
        pages as well as I could before. So I have some requests:
        <UL>
        <LI> If you have an article for me, you are welcome to send it
             to me. But sorry: my answer may take a very long time.
        <LI> If you have a question the tutorial and the FAQ could not answer
             please post it into the mailing list 
             <TT>isdn4linux@listserv.isdn4linux.de</TT> or into the 
             linked Usenet group <TT>de.alt.comm.isdn4linux</TT>.
             Please do not send me e-mails in this case - you may send
             e-mails if you found an error or you have an article, of course.
        <LI> Please do not call me at home - it is senseless because of the
             reasons I listed above. When I'm at home I want to have a 
             minimum of private life ;-)

WWW page archive tells you how to connect to your provider via
<UL>
<LI>ISDN and synchronous PPP 
<LI>a modem and asynchronous PPP.
</UL> 
You can easily adapt the described scripts with some configuration files.
<P>

For people having some experience with this stuff there is more: some pages
tell you how to setup a system with offline email, offline Usenet news and 
some other things.
