Gentle Reader,

in this archive you find a complete easy-to-use tutorial concerning ISDN
and syncPPP. You also find a lot of advices to build up a comfortable
"leafsite": how to install an offline email system, an offline Usenet
server, an answering machine, how to make "fax on demand" and how to
create a fax machine (may be, some of these things come later).

You may distribute this archive and vary it, but do not remove my name,

notices. Please pass me a note, if you want to publicate or vary the package.

LYNX users: please load index.html (German) or index_e.html (English).

In the subdirectory "scripts" are some script files (as described in the
WWW pages). They are mostly ready-to-use. There also is a database of provider 
data. I would be pleased if you send me your entries.

In the subdirectory "FAQ" is the complete ISDN4linux FAQ, compressed (MS-DOS
PKZIP and Linux GNUZIP) and uncompressed. Please read it carefully before
asking questions to me or to the ISDN4Linux mailinglist (see tutorial).

Have fun!
