<H3>Running a fax machine</H3>

... would be a great thing. But it will take some time until I'm able to
handle it. Please do not ask for it before the end of the year - even then it 
maybe not finished... I think will use the combination of <TT>mgetty</TT> and
<TT>sendfax</TT>, which seems to work well as some guys in the Usenet told.
<P>

Gert Doering, the <TT>mgetty+sendfax</TT> developer wrote in the i4l mailing
list, that his software soon will work with ISDN4Linux perhaps (you need a fax 
modem yet). We will have to wait for it...
<P>

There is one possibility to prepare an operating fax system: take an old
2400 baud modem (with fax ability) or better a 14400 one and use it with 
mgetty; connect it to your ISDN telephone station. If there are cables free.
Here are no one free, and I can't :-(
