<H4>The Kernel</H4>

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>O</B></FONT>nce 
upon a time there was the 1.2.13 kernel, which was included in the most 
distributions. This kernel did a goodjob for i4l, when no ISDN drivers 
existed in the kernel code, but the development stopped at version 0.7.3beta.
So i4l users mostly used kernels younger than 1.3.68, the so-called 
"hacker kernels".
<P>

These days you should take a kernel version 1.3.97 or younger (there are 
kernel internal drivers available since kernel 1.3.69, but this thing only 
is stable enough since 1.3.97).
<P>

Now, while kernel 2.0 is released, we will talk about this kernel. Nowadays
it is recommended to use kernel version 2.0.27, which cooperates flawlessly
with isdn4k-utils-2.0.
You should look for the kernel at your SunSite, e.g. at

<PRE>
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/linux/Linus/v2.0/">ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/linux/Linus/v2.0/</a>
</PRE>

(e.g. linux-2.0.27.tar.gz; this kernel runs at the author's machine since 
months without any problems). And you also should fetch the new 
<TT>modules</TT> package:

<PRE>
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/linux/Linus/v2.0/modules-2.0.0.tar.gz">ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/linux/Linus/v2.0/modules-2.0.0.tar.gz</a>
</PRE>

Handle the kernel as you are used to - have a look at the kernel-HOWTO:

<PRE>
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/linux/sunsite/docs/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.gz">ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/linux/sunsite/docs/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.gz</A>
</PRE>

You should decompree your modules and install them as described in the 
Kernel-HOWTO.
<P>

If you want to use isdn4linux to drive an ISDN card you don't need to apply 
any more a patch to this kernel (only kernel 2.0.0 needed the 
two patches isdn4kernel-2.0-patch1+2). <B>But:</B> Most passive ISDN cards
with Siemens chip set (Teles, Creatix, AVM, Elsa, ...) only work, if you use
the driver package "HiSax". If you run such a card you must fetch this driver, too, and put it into<TT>/usr/src</TT>:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/isdn4linux/HiSax/">ftp.franken.de/pub/isdn4linux/HiSax/</A>
</PRE>
(e.g. version 1.5; read the README to learn which cards are supported!)
Now patch it into the kernel:
<PRE>
  root:# cd /usr/src
  root:# tar zxfv HiSax_1.5.patch_for_2.0.tar.gz
  root:# patch -p &lt;HiSax_1.5.patch_for_2.0
  root:# _
</PRE>

You must set now the following items while "make config" or its graphical 
relatives "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig" to compile the kernel:

<PRE>
<B>Code maturity level options":</B>
  Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers: No
<B>Section "General Setup":</B>
  Networking support: Yes
<B>Section "Networking options":</B>
  TCP/IP networking: Yes
  <I>all other items are up to you</I>
<B>Section "Network device support":</B>
  Network device support: Yes
  PPP (point-to-point) support: Yes  
  <I>all other items are up to you</I>
<B>Section "ISDN subsystem":</B>
  <I>Only if you need isdn4linux:</I>
  ISDN support: Yes
  Support synchronous PPP: Yes (!)
  Use VJ compression with synchronous PPP: Yes
  Support audio via ISDN: Yes
  Support generic MP (RFC 1717): Yes
  <I>Mark your own PC card here, too.</I>
</PRE>

If this kernel later works properly you could think about defining some of
the parts of it to modules instead of using a monolithic kernel.


<H4>ISDN Card Driver Software</H4>

If you only want to use a modem (analogous modem or ISDN modem) you may
skip this section.
<P>

If you want to drive an ISDN card you also need the <U>current</U> version of
Fritz Elfert's "isdn4kernel utilities". If you have an older version of 
isdn4linux you must update: the command "<TT>isdnctrl pppbind</TT>" must
exist! Find out -  type in <TT>isdnctrl</TT> and have a look at the available
options.

<PRE>
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/isdn4linux/v2.0/isdn4k-utils-2.0.tar.gz">ftp.franken.de/pub/isdn4linux/isdn4k-utils-2.0.tar.gz</A>
</PRE>

Put it into the /usr/src directory and unpack it by 
"<TT>tar zxfv isdn4k-utils-2.0.tar.gz</TT>". Now in the directory

<PRE>
  /usr/src/isdn4k-utils-2.0
</PRE>

you find all the files you need to operate i4l.

Some Linux distributions lack of some important links, so you need to change
some of the make files. These make files are all in the subdirectory 
<TT>tools</TT>. 
<B>/usr/src/isdn4k-utils-2.0/tools/Makefile</B>
  <I>remove "isdnbutton-1.1" in the following line,
  if you don't have Motif - or you will get compiler errors.</I>
  SUBDIRS=imon imontty-0.3 isdnlog-2.41 isdnbutton-1.1 tcltk
  [...]

<B>/usr/src/isdn4k-utils-2.0/tools/imontty-0.3/Makefile</B>
  [...]
  LDFLAGS=-lncurses -lm
  [...]

<B>/usr/src/isdn4k-utils-2.0/tools/isdnlog-2.41/Makefile</B>
  [...]
  LIB         = -lgdbm
  [...]
</PRE>

At first the programs need to be built. Therefore go into the 
<TT>/usr/src/isdn4k-utils-2.0</TT> directory, compile it by typing in
"<TT>make</TT>", create the ISDN device files by "<TT>make devices</TT>" and 
finally install all executables by "<TT>make install</TT>" in the 
/sbin directory (also the man pages where they need to be).
<P>

You also need to define the card parameters - please read the ISDN4Linux manual

<PRE>
  /usr/src/linux/Documentation/isdn/README
</PRE>

These parameters will be set while booting or while loading the i4l modules.
<P>


<H2>Configuration</H2>

<I><B>Hint:</B><BR>
There are some large script files following. They are downloadable within
this tutorial package - just click onto the script headlines!
</I>

<I><B>Remark for readers who are familiar with my tutorial:</B><BR>
The scripts have changed heavily. There is no longer a command <TT>isdn</TT>,
all things are now handled by a script package named <TT>connect</TT>.
This package can handle now modems, too!</I>
<BR>

<H3>Configuration files</H3>

Two central files are used for setup and maintaining connections: The first one
is called while machine boot-up, it lays in the startup directory and is named
<TT>rc.connect</TT>. The other one is <TT>connect</TT> and is responsible
for establishing and deleting connections and more.
<P>

Eine Reihe weiterer Dateien m&uuml;ssen angelegt werden. So ist f&uuml;r 
jeden Provider je eine Datei pro Einwahl-Telefonnummer herzustellen, in der
alle wichtigen Daten enthalten sind. Die PPP-D&auml;monen ben&ouml;tigen
&uuml;berdies ein paar weitere Dateien. Das werden wir nun der Reihe nach
besprechen.
<P>

There are also some more files necessary. So you need one file per provider
and per dial-in number. And the PPP daemons need some more files, too.
We will discuss this now.
<P>

If you did load down this WWW pages as package "leafsite.tar.gz", you
find the scripts in the subdirectory "scripts".
<P>


<H3>Some Pre Work</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<SMALL>
  If you have used the old "isdn" package before, stop the isdn system
  using
  <PRE>
    root:# &lt;startup_path&gt;/i4l stop (or "rc.isdn stop" or whatever)
    root:# _
  </PRE>    
  (<TT>&lt;startup_path&gt;</TT> is the path, where all the system bootup
  files are located). 
  <P>

  Then remove (or save, if you like) some old files:
  <PRE>
    root:# rm &lt;startup_path&gt;/i4l (if you use a newer SuSE distribution)
    root:# rm &lt;startup_path&gt;/rc.isdn
    root:# rm /sbin/isdn
    root:# rm /etc/i4l.provider (or /etc/i4l.config, if older "isdn" version)
    root:# rm /etc/i4l.secrets  (or /etc/i4l.param, if older "isdn" version)
    root:# _
  </PRE>
</SMALL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

You have to create some directories for the beginning:
<PRE>
  root:# mkdir /usr/lib/connect
  root:# mkdir /usr/lib/connect/providers
  root:# mkdir /var/lib/connect
  root:# _
</PRE>


<H3>Provider Data</H3>

In <TT>/usr/lib/connect/providers</TT> for each provider and each dial-in
number is needed. Files for isdn4linux and for modems look slightly
different. Here some cutted examples - you can load down some examples, 
containing more explanations. Name these files as you like, but don't use
a connect keyword (on, off, status, help, maxtries, route, device, all).
<P>

<A HREF="scripts/prov-d1">Beispiel f&uuml;r eine isdn4linux-Datei</A>
<PRE>
  #!/bin/bash
  MODE=i4l
  PHONE=0891234567
  IP_ADDRESS=123.234.210.109
  OPTIONS_FILE=/etc/ppp/options.ipppd
</PRE>

<A HREF="scripts/prov-a1">Beispiel f&uuml;r eine Modem-Datei</A>
<PRE>
  #!/bin/bash
  MODE=modem
  IP_ADDRESS=234.123.134.56
  DEVICE=ttyS1
  OPTIONS_FILE=/etc/ppp/options.pppd
  CHAT_SCRIPT="ABORT BUSY ABORT 'NO CARRIER' '' ATZ0 OK ATD0,08912345 CONNECT"
</PRE>

This files define some environment variables, which are used in the scripts
described here. <TT>MODE</TT> tells connect whether it shall call i4l or
drive a modem, <TT>IP_ADDRESS</TT> is the IP address of the remote you want
to dial in, <TT>OPTIONS_FILE</TT> is the (i)pppd options file for this
remote. isdn4linux needs the telephone number of the remote (<TT>PHONE</TT>),
and pppd needs a chat script (<TT>CHAT_SCRIPT</TT>) and the serial port name
(<TT>DEVICE</TT>), where the modem is connected.
<P>

You can load down a <A HREF="scripts/i4l.provider.db">database with 
date for several universities and other providers</A>.
<P>

By the way: I would be pleased to get the configuration file for your
provider - just 
<A HREF="mailto:hailer@ilo.baynet.de?subject=i4l-config">mail it</A>!
<P>

<H3>Default Values</H3>

Some data are loaded while system startup. Therefore you must write a
configuration file. Here is mine:

# This only works for isdn4linux connections.
declare -i HUPTIMEOUT

</PRE>

The shell functions <TT>Con_Start()</TT> and <TT>Con_Stop()</TT> are called
from the script <TT>rc.connect</TT> - these functions are very interesting if 
you load your ISDN subsystem as modules: enter here the commands for loading
and unloading the modules. Examples for the Teles and the HiSax driver are 
printed here (I'm using currently HiSax 1.4 to drive a Teles 16.3 card).
<P>

Here also some default values are defined. 
<TT>DEFAULT_REMOTES</TT> contains the file names of the remotes which
shall be called by default (if you define more than one, "connect" tries to
call one after the other until the connection establishes).
<TT>DEFAULT_MAX_TRIES</TT> says how often this should happen. 
<TT>HUPTIMEOUT</TT> is valid only for isdn4linux. Enter here after how many
idle time isdn4linux shall hang up (modems: read the manual, please). 
And <TT>DEFAULT_DEVICE</TT> is the name of the serial interface the modem 
normally is connected.
<P>

We will discuss now this script <TT>rc.connect</TT>.


<H3>What Happens While Booting</H3>

There are two possibilities Linux may boot. One is <TT>simpleinit</TT> 
(e.g. Slackware), the other one (more complicated, but also more flexible)
is <TT>sysvinit</TT> (S.u.S.E. since 4.0, Debian, Caldera, 
Red Hat...). These two need different linking of the ISDN startup scripts.


<H4>simpleinit</H4>

<TT>simpleinit</TT> has its startup scripts in <TT>/etc/rc.d/</TT>. There are 
some single scripts. Important for us are the files <TT>rc.M</TT> (calls
some startup scripts) and <TT>rc.6</TT> (reboot script). In this directory
we set a new file named <TT>rc.isdn</TT>, which starts up the ISDN system.
<P>

You must create this file. Before this you must add the following to
<TT>/etc/rc.d/rc.M</TT>, because this new file must be known by the booting 
system:

<PRE>
<B>/etc/rc.d/rc.M, section "# Initialize the NET subsystem."</B>
  . /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1
  . /etc/rc.d/rc.connect    # &lt;-- add this line!
  . /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2
</PRE>


<H4>sysvinit</H4>

Under <TT>sysvinit</TT> the start-up is completely different. Here the scripts
are in the directory <TT>/sbin/init.d/, /etc/init.d</TT> or 
<TT>/etc/rc.d/</TT>. The scripts do have two functionalities: called with the 
argument "<TT>start</TT>" it starts up a part of the system, called with
the argument "<TT>stop</TT>" it shuts down. This whole thing works with 
so-called "run levels"; level 0 is "system halt", level 1 is "single
user mode", level 2 commonly is "multi user mode with network" and  level 3 is 
"with xdm", and finally level 6 is running shutdown. The
system calls the first three levels one after the other while startup (using 
"<TT>start</TT>"). In run level 6 they are called vice versa (using 
"<TT>stop</TT>").
<P>

This sequence is a bit "tricky": a "master script" looks into the
directory of the run level (<TT>./rc1.d, ./rc2.d, ./rc3.d</TT> and so on) what 
to do. Therein are a lot of soft links to the scripts I wrote above. All links 
are named
<PRE>
  S<I>nnScriptName</I>
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
  K<I>nnScriptName</I>
</PRE>
with a number <TT><I>nn</I></TT>, which tells the master script in which order 
it has to call these scripts. So if we create a script - let's call it 
<TT>rc.connect</TT> again -, we must also set two links in the runlevel 2 
directory <TT>./rc2.d</TT>:
<PRE>
  root:# cd /sbin/init.d/rc2.d  # (please verify path!!)
  root:# ln -s ../rc.connect K20rc.connect
  root:# ln -s ../rc.connect S20rc.connect
  root:# _
</PRE>

 <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>
 <B>Remark for  S.u.S.E. users (version 4 and newer):</B>
 A similar file exists here, named <TT>i4l</TT>, also there may exist a file
 <TT>i4l_hardware</TT>. These files must be removed, and also their calling
 scripts in <TT>/sbin/init.d/rc2.d</TT>. Of course so the <TT>I4L_*</TT> 
 entries in the S.u.S.E. configuration file <TT>/etc/rc.config</TT> are 
 obsolete now.
 <P>

 Sorry for this inconvenience, but this is necessary to get a
 distribution independent package.
 </SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H4>System Start and Stop</H4>

The file(s) you need for <TT>simpleinit</TT> or for <TT>sysvinit</TT> you
can load down as usual in this tutorial. Because the script is awfully big
I only descripe here how the ISDN subsystem is booted within this script
(modems don't need startup sections). Just load and install this script as
described above.
<PRE>
<B><A HREF="scripts/rc.connect">/sbin/init.d/rc.connect</A></B> (cutting)
  /sbin/isdnctrl verbose 0  # For debugging set to 2 (max. 4)
  # ISDN device drivers     ippp0 (PPP)
  /sbin/isdnctrl addif      ippp0
  /sbin/isdnctrl pppbind    ippp0 0
  /sbin/isdnctrl addphone   ippp0 out $PHONE      # dial-out number
  /sbin/isdnctrl addphone   ippp0 in $MY_PHONE    # my telephone no
  /sbin/isdnctrl eaz        ippp0 $MY_EAZ         # my MSN / EAZ
  /sbin/isdnctrl huptimeout ippp0 $HUPTIMEOUT     # defined in $BASE
  /sbin/isdnctrl secure     ippp0 on              # nobody may enter
  /sbin/isdnctrl l2_prot    ippp0 hdlc
  /sbin/isdnctrl l3_prot    ippp0 trans
  /sbin/isdnctrl encap      ippp0 syncppp
  /sbin/ifconfig ippp0 $MY_HOSTNAME pointopoint $IP_ADDRESS metric 1
  /sbin/route add default ippp0                   # interface definitions 
  /sbin/ipppd /dev/ippp0 file $OPTIONS_FILE &
  /sbin/route del default
  ifconfig ippp0 down
</PRE>

Some people must edit the PATH in this script!
<P>

You must make this file executable by typing in <TT>chmod 744</TT> now.
<P>

You see: some of the environment variables defined above are used here!
Some commands are remarkable: the "pppbind" command is against side
effects, if more than one ipppd is started. If you don't call this command,
all ipppd's use the passwords defined for the first one! The last two
commands are also essential: only if no ipppd is up you can start a 
regular pppd for modems without problems!
<P>

By the way: We don't call the standard PPP daemon pppd 2.2.0[ef] here, but an 
especially patched version named "ipppd". This pppd is part of the ISDN4Linux 
package and is set while installation to /sbin. Anyway the PPP HOWTO and the 
pppd manpage is valid.
<P>


<H3>More Files</H3>

To get this stuff working you must edit some more files as root:
Either pppd or ipppd use the file <TT>/etc/ppp/options</TT> to load central
configuration parameters. You can tell the (i)pppd with the command line
argument <TT>file</TT> to load more files - we already have defined these 
files while building our remote files (<TT>OPTIONS_FILE</TT>). 
Here now <TT>/etc/ppp/options</TT>, which <I>always is loaded</I>:
<PRE>
<A HREF="scripts/options"><B>/etc/ppp/options</B></A>
# comment out the following three lines if you don't need 
# dynamic IP negotiation.
ipcp-accept-local
ipcp-accept-remote
noipdefault
# more pppd/ipppd options
lock
mru 1500
mtu 1500
debug
-detach
</PRE>

If you don't dynamically receive your IP from your provider you must comment
out the first three options. The rest is needed always.

Now let's have a look at the extra option files. They are necessary, because
<UL>
<LI>the ipppd needs other options than the pppd,
<LI>the options vary from provider to provider.
</UL>

<PRE>
<A HREF="scripts/options.pppd.prov-1"><B>sample file for the pppd</B></A>
   pppd</B></A>

# /etc/ppp/options for ipppd
useifip
-vjccomp
-ac
-pc
-detach
-bsdcomp
-vj
user hailer
</PRE>

<B>Remark to option "</B><TT>-vj</TT><B>":</B> If you don't define this option 
the system may get very angry. X Window sessions simply may hang, while
common vt100 sessions may show some "kernel oopses". You may especially see 
the line "<TT>Aiee, killing interrupt handler</TT>". The option 
<TT>useifip</TT> is against side effects, if more than one ipppd is running.

<PRE>
<B>/etc/resolv.conf:</B> (see provider database)
search <I>&lt;what_you_need&gt;</I>
nameserver <I>&lt;IP 1st nameserver&gt;</I> 
nameserver <I>&lt;IP 2nd nameserver&gt;</I> 
nameserver <I>&lt;IP 3rd nameserver&gt;</I>
</PRE>

You may enter here max. three nameservers. At "search" you can enter where
short hostnames shall be searched. Example: If you have a "search" entry
like this: <TT>search lrz-muenchen.de</TT> the command <TT>ping sun3</TT>
will find <TT>sun3.lrz-muenchen.de</TT>.

<PRE>

</PRE>


<H3>Authentification</H3>

You must authentificate yourself at the provider if you use PPP. Therefore
two methods exist: PAP (Password Authentification Protocol) and CHAP 
(Challenge Authentification Protocol). PAP is widely used, but CHAP offers
the provider more security. The secrets are in the file 
<TT>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</TT> or <TT>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</TT>.
<B>Attention!</B> The<TT>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</TT> file contains passwords
and must be secured in any cases against unauthorized access!
<PRE>
  root:# chmod 600 /etc/ppp/pap-secrets (or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets)
  root:# _
</PRE>
<P>


<H4>PAP</H4>

<PRE>
<B>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</B>
  # Secrets for authentification using PAP
  # client          server           secret          IP addresses
  <I>&lt;provider_login&gt;</I>  <I>&lt;1st provider&gt;</I>   '<I>&lt;password&gt;</I>'    -
  <I>&lt;provider_login&gt;</I>  <I>&lt;2nd provider&gt;</I>   '<I>&lt;password&gt;</I>'    -
</PRE>

Remarks: 
<UL>
<LI>It is recommended to nest the password in apostrophes. So no error 
    appears if a "#" is in the password. (Thanks to Michael Matschilles 
    <TT>&lt;mat@pascal.bmw.de&gt;</TT> for the hint!)
<LI>In many cases it is easier to enter an asterisk "*" instead of the
    provider's name in the server column.
</UL>     
<P>

Don't forget to secure it with <TT>chmod 600 /etc/ppp/pap-secrets</TT>!


<H4>CHAP</H4>

Providers don't know your fully qualified hostname in most cases. So you have 
to rename your machine to the same name as your login at your provider - don't 
use a domain. But you can do it a more elegant way: give 
"<TT>name <I>&lt;provider_login&gt;</I></TT>" as option while calling the
ipppd (or make an entry in <TT>/etc/ppp/options</TT>). Instead of 
<TT>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</TT> you must create a file 
<TT>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</TT> like this (please note: there are <I>two</I> 
lines required per provider entry!):
<PRE>
<B>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</B>
  # Secrets for authentification using CHAP
  # client          server             secret       IP addresses
  <I>&lt;provider_login&gt;</I>  <I>&lt;1st provider&gt;</I>      <I>&lt;password&gt;</I>
  <I>&lt;1st provider&gt;</I>     <I>&lt;provider_login&gt;</I>   ""
  <I>&lt;provider_login&gt;</I>  <I>&lt;2nd provider&gt;</I>      <I>&lt;password&gt;</I>
  <I>&lt;2nd provider&gt;</I>     <I>&lt;provider_login&gt;</I>   ""
</PRE>

Don't forget to secure it with <TT>chmod 600 /etc/ppp/chap-secrets</TT>!


<H3>Some Polish</H3>

Now you should bend the PPP log to an extra file for debugging.
Therefore you should edit <TT>/etc/syslog.conf</TT> and add the following line
(remark: use only tabulator characters, <I>no spaces!</I>):

<PRE>
  daemon.*                      /var/log/ppp-log
</PRE>

With this all the stuff the PPP daemon tells is saved to /var/log/ppp-log.
<P>

<H2>Running</H2>

The system sometimes likes to connect more or less without any motivation
to the provider. This is because of the nature of the system: If there is any
IP packet (e.g. a name server request) Linux wants to get rid of it. Because 
this costs money we must switch it off. You could do it by deleting the
default route, so that Linux now doesn't know any longer the way out.
<P>

The newer kernels since 1.3.100 have a something painful behavior: they
set the default route automatically when a interface is defined. To 
prevent collisions you need to wait until a connect is <I>completely</I> 
built up (dialing, PPP handshake) before setting the default route.
The following script does this. It is written so that you may call it
more than once, so the first application (e.g. exchanging email) makes
the connect, and the next applications don't need to open more lines. The
last application cleans up: it hangs up and deletes the default route.
Call this script as <TT>/sbin/connect on</TT> und <TT>/sbin/connect off</TT>.
Here's only a very short example; you can load down a very sophisticated
script by clicking onto the headline.
<P>

Put the script to /sbin and make it executable (route may be called only by 
"root"!):
<PRE>
  root:# chmod 744 /sbin/connect
  root:# _
</PRE>

<PRE>
<B><A HREF="scripts/connect">/sbin/connect</A></B>
  #! /bin/bash

  PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin

  #  ISDN4Linux:

  case $1 in
    on)
      isdnctrl dial ippp0       #  connect
      sleep 5                   #  wait until open
      route add default ippp0   #  set route
      ;;
    off)
      isdnctrl hangup ippp0     #  disconnect
      route del default         #  and delete route
      ;;
    *)
      echo -e "\a Usage: 'isdn on' or 'isdn off'"
      ;;
  esac

  # Modem:

  IF_FILE=/var/lib/connect/interface
  case $1 in
    on)
      pppd connect "chat $CHAT_SCRIPT" file $OPTIONS_FILE /dev/$DEVICE &
      # the interface name was saved now by /etc/ppp/ip-up in IF_FILE.
      sleep 1
      echo "Sleeping 40 seconds for establishing connection..."
      sleep 40
      read INTERFACE &lt;$IF_FILE
      route add default $INTERFACE
      ;;
    off)
      kill -HUP `cat /var/lock/LCK..$DEVICE`
      route del default
      ;;
  esac
</PRE>

Some people must edit the PATH in this script!
<P>

For modem usage INTERFACE must be retrieved with a trick: while startup of
pppd the script <TT>/etc/ppp/ip-up</TT> is called with these arguments:
<PRE>
  ip-up interface device speed local_address remote_address
</PRE>
And we use that. We create a file ip-up:
<PRE>
<A HREF="scripts/ip-up"><B>/etc/ppp/ip-up</B></A>
#!/bin/bash
# This script is called by (i)pppd while starting up.
# It is called this way:
#   ip-up interface device speed local_address remote_address.
#   So you can get the used interface by fetching $1
echo $1 >/tmp/connect_interface.tmp
</PRE>
And so we have saved the interface name!
<P>

<B>Hints for more experiments:</B>
<UL>
<LI>The "isdnctrl dial ippp0" makes the connection - from there on it costs 
your money. We prevent connection failures this way because the system can
hang after the connect took place (may be an error in ipppd). These hangs may 
appear if the system must dial <I>after</I> the connect command (telnet etc.).
<LI>It is also important that you set the default route <I>after</I> 
completion of the connect. Otherways the kernel kills the route too early
and sends messages like "<TT>network not reachable</TT>", if you want to
connect to another computer.
</UL>
<P>

<B>Test:</B>
<PRE>
  root:# connect
  Calling ippp0
  Dialing of ippp0 triggered
  Sleeping 8 sec for PPP handshaking...
  Line open - checking...
  :-) Line is ok - have fun!
  root:# telnet sun3
  [...]
</PRE>
(now log in as usual; later type in "exit" to finish)
<PRE>
  root:# connect off
  Last application stopped - closing line.
  prov0 hung up
  prov1 already closed! To force closing use "connect off all"
  root:# _
</PRE>
</PRE>


<H2>What can "connect" do?</H2>

You just learned about the first two possibilities:
<PRE>
"connect" (or "connect on")        connect default remote
"connect off"                      disconnect
</PRE>
Important command:
<PRE>
"connect off all"                  disconnects <I>all</I> channels
</PRE>
It is easy to connect to other remotes:
<PRE>
"connect <I>remote1</I> (on)"             connect to <I>remote1</I>
"connect <I>remote1</I> off"              and disconnect from it
</PRE>
If you enter more than one remotes in the command line, one after another
will be tried, until a connection establishes.
<PRE>
"connect <I>remote1</I> <I>remote2</I> <I>remote3</I> ..."
</PRE>
You also may build more than one connection at the same time. Of course
it is nonsense to set the defaultroute more than one time; you need to
set special routes for each remote:
<PRE>
"connect <I>remote1</I> route <I>Netz-IP</I>"    connect via route
"connect <I>remote2</I> route default"    connect via defaultroute
</PRE>
The route must match the remote! You don't really need "route default.
<P>
If the dial-in ports of your provider are heavily loaded, you may want to
have a maximum number of dial attempts:
<PRE>
"connect <I>remote1</I> maxtries <I>number</I>"       
</PRE>
If you don't enter a "<TT>maxtries</TT>" the default value is taken from
<TT>/usr/lib/connect/base</TT>.
<P>
And this is similar:
<PRE>
"connect <I>remote1</I> device ttyS<I>n</I>"       
</PRE>
So you tell "connect" where your modem is connected, if you want to use a 
modem. If you don't enter a "<TT>device</TT>" the default device is taken from
<TT>/usr/lib/connect/base</TT>.


<H2>More Utilities</H2>

There are some more very useful tools within the ISDN4Linux package.
One is the X program "isdnmon" by Andreas Kool, wich shows the actual state
of the S<SUB>0</SUB> bus (free or connected). Michael Knigge's "imon" does the
same in terminals. Also very useful is "isdnlog" by Andreas Kool, which gives
information about the S0 bus activity. With "imontty" by Volker Goetz you can
get a print-out of the ISDN card activity - very useful for scripts!
<P>

Have a look at the README by Fritz Elfert.
