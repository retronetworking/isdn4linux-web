know it: If you want to load down a big file from a distant server (overseas
perhaps), the maximum transfer rate can not be reached. If you are using ISDN
it is extreme. But you have no ISDN Port to spend the telecom union your money,
and you use the best operating system in the world :-) People who can access
the Internet via a university and send some Unix commands to it, can do
something.
<P>


<H2>Theory</H2>

But how? The trick is to load the file not directly, but let the provider do
it for you. After some time you can load the desired file from the provider
without wasting time - the connection to your provider most times is so fast
that you reach the maximum transfer rate. Unix knows the command <TT>nohup</TT>
which allows a command execution without being logged in - this is the trick.
You can log in at your provider and type in:
<PRE>
  provider:# nohup ftp -i ftp.leo.org &amp;
  provider:# exit
  connection closed by foreign host.
  root:# _
</PRE>
This takes only a few seconds, only one tariff unit is lost for a good 
purpose.
<P>

But you have to do some prework, because <TT>ftp</TT> is an interactive 
program, which needs a lot of information for its work (e.g. what to load).
You can tell ftp how to be less interactive by giving the option "-i". 
But you need to tell ftp the information what to do, and this happens if you
create a file <TT>.netrc</TT> at your provider. (The option "-n" tells 
ftp to ignore this file.)
<P>

If you want, for example, load down the Linux kernel 2.0.7 from the LEO.ORG 
server (more than 5 Megabytes!) the file <TT>.netrc</TT> could look like:
<PRE>
<B>provider:~/.netrc</B>
  machine ftp.leo.org
  login anonymous
  password <I>&lt;my@email.address&gt;</I>
  macdef init
    lcd /usr/src
    cd /pub/comp/os/linux/Linus/v2.0
    bin
    get linux-2.0.7.tar.gz
    close
    quit
</PRE>

So cou could create an entry for each server you want to connect. This file
must be stored in your directory at your provider before you call the
<TT>nohup ftp</TT> command. One hour later you can load down directly your
kernel. Great, isn't it?


<H2>Automotion</H2>

Ok now. Now we want to do it automatically. Of course we need the cron again,
which will do the data transfer in the cheap night hours.

I had no time to do more research - but some people wrote me hints.

Hello,

you should point at "ncftp" for ftp-on-demand. I open the program using
"nohup ncftp", open the server I need, choose the file using the "tab" 
expansion and start the download. A ctrl-Z and "bg" move the download into
background and myself in the commandline to stop the connect.

Some nice scripts:

getme &lt;Server&gt; &lt;Dir&gt; &lt;File&gt;
cronftp must be started using cron. You can fetch your file the next day.

fetfrom also may be useful.

-----------getme--------------
#!/usr/local/bin/bash

# Parameters: Server Path File(s)

FTPFILE="/tmp/.$UID.ftpjobs"
echo Server : $1
echo Dir    : $2
echo "File   : $3"
echo Jobfile: $FTPFILE

touch $FTPFILE

echo lcd ~/tmp/ftpjobs &gt;&gt$FTPFILE
echo open $1 &gt;&gt;$FTPFILE
echo user anonymous t8231ah@sunmail.lrz-muenchen.de &gt;&gt;$FTPFILE
echo bin &gt;&gt;$FTPFILE
echo "cd $2" &gt;&gt;$FTPFILE
echo "mget $3" &gt;&gt;$FTPFILE
echo close &gt;&gt;$FTPFILE
-------------------------------

---------getfrom---------------
echo Hole $2 von $1...
echo ftp -i $1 &gt;&gt;~/tmp/ftpjob
echo bin &gt;&gt;~/TMP/ftpjob
echo cd $2 &gt;&gt;~/tmp/ftpjob
-------------------------------

---------cronftp--------------
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
FTPFILE="/tmp/.$UID.ftpjobs"
NEWFTPFILE="/tmp/.bgjob_$UID_$RANDOM"
mkdir ~/tmp/ftpjobs
echo Using $FTPFILE... as $NEWFTPFILE
mv $FTPFILE $NEWFTPFILE
nohup ftp -in &lt;$NEWFTPFILE &

Did you hear about FTPMAIL? Perhaps this matches the purpose and is a bit
simpler.

Just write an e-mail to ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de 
subject HELP
body:
help
quit


---------------
This server at the Uni allows to fetch any file from all over the world 
to Stuttgart. It mails this file in uuencoded format to you. So only the
providers transfer data rate is the limiting factor.

You find detailled descriptions in the net. Search for FTPMAIL at Yahoo or 
Altavista.

Tschau
