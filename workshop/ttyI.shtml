       ttyI, cui - ISDN character devices with modem emulator


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <EM>ttyI</EM><STRONG>[</STRONG><EM>0-63</EM><STRONG>]</STRONG>  and  <EM>cui</EM><STRONG>[</STRONG><EM>0-63</EM><STRONG>]</STRONG> are emulated tty devices of the
       Linux ISDN subsystem.  These devices can be  used  in  the
       same way as the traditional serial devices <EM>ttySx</EM> and <EM>cuax</EM>.
       The official major device numbers are <STRONG>43</STRONG> for <EM>ttyI</EM>  and  <STRONG>44</STRONG>
       for  <EM>cui</EM>.   The  minor device numbers start with <STRONG>0</STRONG> and end
       with <STRONG>63</STRONG>.

       The ISDN tty devices are equipped with a  modem  emulation
       implementing a set of traditional and some special AT com­
       mands. This provides easy use  together  with  almost  all
       communication  software  that  uses  modem commands: <STRONG>mini­</STRONG>
       <STRONG>com</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>seyon</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>XCept</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>uucico</STRONG>(8), <STRONG>mgetty</STRONG>(8),  <STRONG>dip</STRONG>(8),
       <STRONG>pppd</STRONG>(8)  and  more.  When enabled during kernel configura­
       tion, the emulator is capable of a reduced set of commands
       to support audio. To use audio features, an ISDN card with
       a audio-capable low-level driver is needed. Currently  the
       only audio-capable drivers are the teles and HiSax driver.

       The line disciplines are handled by  the  kernel  so  that
       SLIP, CSLIP and asynchronous PPP are possible.

       The  port  speed  of  the ISDN tty devices is always 64000
       bps.



</PRE>
<H2>AT COMMAND SET</H2><PRE>
       The description of <STRONG>AT</STRONG> <STRONG>commands</STRONG> here does <STRONG>not</STRONG>  cover  audio
       related  commands. For a description of audio related com­
       mands, see <STRONG>isdn_audio</STRONG>(4).  The following <STRONG>AT</STRONG>  <STRONG>commands</STRONG>  are
       supported by ISDN tty devices:

       <STRONG>ATA</STRONG>    Answer an incoming call.

       <STRONG>ATD</STRONG><EM>num</EM> Dial  number <EM>num</EM>.  Allowed are digits [0-9] and the
              characters ",", "#", ".", "*", "W", "P", "T",  "S",
              "-". The characters are ignored except of "S" which
              indicates a SPV if it  precedes  the  number  (<STRONG>only</STRONG>
              German 1TR6 ISDN).

       <STRONG>ATE0</STRONG>   Echo off.

       <STRONG>ATE1</STRONG>   Echo on (default).

       <STRONG>ATH</STRONG>    Hang up.

       <STRONG>ATH0</STRONG>   Hang up.

       <STRONG>ATH1</STRONG>   Off hook (ignored).


       <STRONG>ATI1</STRONG>   Return device Information ("ISDN for Linux...").

       <STRONG>ATI2</STRONG>   Return Statistics of last connection.

       <STRONG>ATO</STRONG>    Return  from  command  mode  to  online  mode (data
              mode).

       <STRONG>ATQ0</STRONG>   Enable result codes (default).

       <STRONG>ATQ1</STRONG>   Disable result codes.

       <STRONG>ATS</STRONG><EM>x</EM><STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>y</EM> Set register <EM>x</EM> to value <EM>y</EM>.

       <STRONG>ATS</STRONG><EM>x</EM><STRONG>?</STRONG>  Show content of register <EM>x</EM>.

       <STRONG>ATS</STRONG><EM>x</EM><STRONG>.</STRONG><EM>y</EM><STRONG>=</STRONG><EM>z</EM>
              Set register <EM>x</EM>, bit <EM>y</EM> to value <EM>z</EM>

       <STRONG>ATS</STRONG><EM>x</EM><STRONG>.</STRONG><EM>y</EM><STRONG>?</STRONG>
              Show bit <EM>y</EM> of register <EM>x</EM>.

       <STRONG>ATV0</STRONG>   Print result code as number.

       <STRONG>ATV1</STRONG>   Print result code as text (default).

       <STRONG>ATZ</STRONG>    Reset all registers and load profile values.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;B</STRONG><EM>x</EM>  Set packet size of  outgoing  packets  to  value  <EM>x</EM>
              (maximum  4000).  The actual packet size depends on
              the hardware driver and may be smaller than <EM>x</EM> (e.g.
              with the teles driver). There will be <STRONG>no</STRONG> error mes­
              sage if the  value  is  bigger  than  the  hardware
              driver  can process. However the size of the outgo­
              ing packets will be set correctly.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;D2</STRONG>  DTR falling edge: hang up  and  return  to  command
              mode (default).

       <STRONG>AT&amp;D3</STRONG>  DTR  falling  edge: hang up, return to command mode
              and reset all registers.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;E</STRONG><EM>x</EM>  Set MSN (Euro-ISDN, EDSS1) or EAZ (German 1TR6)  to
              value  <EM>x</EM>.  For MSNs, <EM>x</EM> is a string of digits repre­
              senting the local phone number, while  for  EAZs  <EM>x</EM>
              should be only the last digit of the Number.

       <STRONG>AT&amp;F</STRONG>   Set   all   registers   and  profile  to  "factory-
              defaults".

       <STRONG>AT&amp;V</STRONG>   Show current register settings.


       <STRONG>AT&amp;X0</STRONG>  Disable BTX-Mode (default).

       <STRONG>AT&amp;X1</STRONG>  Enable BTX-Mode.


</PRE>
<H2>ESCAPE SEQUENCE</H2><PRE>
       During a data connection, the driver can be set to command
       mode by typing in  <EM>delay</EM><STRONG>+++</STRONG><EM>delay</EM>.   The  escape  character
       (default "+") may be set via register 2. The <EM>delay</EM> must be
       at least 1.5 seconds and between each escape character the
       pause  must  not exceed 0.5 seconds.  <EM>ATO</EM> brings the modem
       emulation back to data mode.

                     register  14 is ignored and the Layer-2-pro­
                     tocol is automatically set with the  follow­
                     ing  values  to  match  the  service  of the
                     incoming call:

                      Incoming service <EM>audio</EM> (Reg. 20.0 = 1)

                             ENT).

                      Incoming service <EM>BTX</EM> (Reg. 20.1 = 1)
                             L2-protocol  is  set  to 0 (X75/LAPB
                             with I-frames).

                      Incoming service <EM>date</EM> (Reg. 20.2 = 1)

              mapped register is set  on  incoming  call  (during
              RING). Mapping is the same like register 18.

       <STRONG>21</STRONG> (read only)
              Bit-mapped  register.  Set on incoming call (during
              RING) to the value of octet 3 of calling party num­
              ber Information Element (Numbering plan).  See sec­
              tion <STRONG>4.5.10</STRONG> of <STRONG>ITU</STRONG> <STRONG>Q.931</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>22</STRONG> (read only)
              Bit-mapped register. Set on incoming  call  (during
              RING)  to  the  value  of octet 3a of calling party
              number Information Element (Screening  info).   See
              section <STRONG>4.5.10</STRONG> of <STRONG>ITU</STRONG> <STRONG>Q.931</STRONG>.
