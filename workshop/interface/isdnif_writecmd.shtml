    This field has <B>to be preset</B> by the HL-driver. The given function will be
    called to perform write-requests on /dev/isdnctrl (i.e. sending commands
    to the card) The data-format is hardware-specific. This function is
    intended for debugging only. It is not necessary for normal operation
    and never will be called by the tty-emulation- or network-code. If
    this function is not supported, the driver has to set NULL here.<P>
