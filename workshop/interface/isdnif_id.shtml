   This string has <B>to be preset</B> by the HL-driver. Its purpose is for
   identification of the driver by the user. Eg.: it is shown in the
   status-info of /dev/isdninfo. Furthermore it is used as Id for binding
   net-interfaces to a specific channel. If a string of length zero is
   given, upon return, isdn4linux will replace it by a generic name. (line0,
   line1 etc.) It is recommended to make this string configurable during
   module-load-time. (copy a global variable to this string.) For doing that,
   modules 1.2.8 or newer are necessary.
