       isdn_audio - audio extension of ttyI ISDN character devices


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This document describes the audio  related  extensions  of
       the modem emulation, provided by <EM>/dev/ttyIx</EM>.

       The  ISDN  tty devices are equipped with a modem emulation
       implementing a set of traditional and some special AT com­
       mands.  This  provides  easy  use together with almost all
       communication software that  uses  modem  commands:  <STRONG>mini­</STRONG>
       <STRONG>com</STRONG>(1),  <STRONG>seyon</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>XCept</STRONG>(1), <STRONG>uucico</STRONG>(8), <STRONG>mgetty</STRONG>(8), <STRONG>dip</STRONG>(8),
       <STRONG>pppd</STRONG>(8) and more. When enabled  during  kernel  configura­
       tion, the emulator is capable of a reduced set of commands
       to support audio. To use audio features, an ISDN card with
       a  audio-capable low-level driver is needed. Currently the
       only audio-capable drivers are the teles and HiSax driver.

       The  port  speed  of  the ISDN tty devices is always 64000
       bps.



</PRE>
<H2>AUDIO RELATED AT COMMAND SET</H2><PRE>
       This description does <STRONG>not</STRONG> include the standard AT  command
       set.  For  a  description  of the standard AT command set,
       provided by the Linux ISDN subsystem,  see  <STRONG>ttyI</STRONG>(4).   All
       commands  starting  with  <STRONG>AT+</STRONG> except <STRONG>AT+FCLASS</STRONG> are enabled
       only, if  audio  mode  is  active.   The  following  <STRONG>audio</STRONG>
       <STRONG>related</STRONG> <STRONG>AT</STRONG> <STRONG>commands</STRONG> are supported by ISDN tty devices:

       <STRONG>AT+FCLASS=0</STRONG>
              Disable  audio  mode  (default).  This command sets
              register <EM>18</EM> to <EM>4</EM>.

       <STRONG>AT+FCLASS=8</STRONG>
              Enable audio mode (default). This command sets reg­
              ister <EM>18</EM> to <EM>5</EM>.

       <STRONG>AT+FCLASS=?</STRONG>
              Show possible modes.

       <STRONG>AT+FCLASS?</STRONG>
              Show current mode.

       <STRONG>AT+VNH=</STRONG><EM>x</EM>
              No function, provided for compatibility only.

       <STRONG>AT+VNH=?</STRONG>
              Always showing "1".

       <STRONG>AT+VNH?</STRONG>
              Always showing "1".

       <STRONG>AT+VLS=</STRONG><EM>x</EM>
              Select line <EM>x</EM>, where <EM>x</EM> is one of the following:

              2 = Phone line.

       <STRONG>AT+VLS=?</STRONG>
              Always showing "0,2".

       <STRONG>AT+VLS?</STRONG>
              Show current line.

       <STRONG>AT+VRX</STRONG> Start  audio recording. See below for more informa­
              tion.

       <STRONG>AT+VSD=</STRONG><EM>x</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG><EM>y</EM>
              No function, provided for compatibility only.  Pos­
              sible parameters:

       <STRONG>AT+VSM?</STRONG>
              Show current audio data format.

       <STRONG>AT+VTX</STRONG> Start  audio  playback. See below for more informa­
              tion.

<H2>GENERAL BEHAVIOUR</H2><PRE>
       On incoming calls, if the application responds to  a  <STRONG>RING</STRONG>
       by sending <STRONG>ATA</STRONG>, depending on the calling service, the emu­
       lator responds with either <STRONG>CONNECT</STRONG>  (data  call)  or  <STRONG>VCON</STRONG>
       (voice call).

       When  starting  audio  playback or recording, the emulator
       responds with <STRONG>CONNECT</STRONG>.   After  that,  the  data  transfer
       in  a  <STRONG>single</STRONG> command. In this case, <STRONG>no</STRONG> CONNECT message is
       sent to the application and the protocol  described  below
       is started immediately.

       When  stopping  audio  playback  or recording, the message
       returned by the emulator depends on how the data  transfer
       is  stopped.  If  the data transfer is stopped by a remote
       hangup, <STRONG>NO</STRONG> <STRONG>CARRIER</STRONG> is sent to the application, while stop­
       ping  data transfer with one of the DLE sequences, <STRONG>VCON</STRONG> is
       sent. In any case, the message is preceeded by the  appro­
       priate  DLE  sequence  for  end of audio data and/or abort
       respectively.

       On outgoing voice calls, the emulator responds  with  <STRONG>VCON</STRONG>
       upon connection setup.

<H2>AUDIO DATA FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       When recording or playing back audio data, a kind of modi­
       fied bisync protocol is used. When recording  audio  data,
       the  modem  emulator is considered to be the <STRONG>sender</STRONG>, while
       the application is the <STRONG>receiver</STRONG>.  When playing back,  this
       relationship  is  reversed:  The  modem  emulator  acts as
       <STRONG>receiver</STRONG>, while the application is the <STRONG>sender</STRONG>.   With  the
       bisync  protocol  the  character  <STRONG>DLE</STRONG> (0x10) has a special
       meaning and is used  like  an  escape  character.   It  is
       always  followed  by a second character which has the fol­
       lowing meanings defined:

       <STRONG>ETX</STRONG> (0x03)
              End of audio data. This code has to be sent by  the
              <STRONG>sender</STRONG>, indicating end of audio data.

       <STRONG>DC4</STRONG> (0x14)
              Abort  sending.  This  code  has  to be sent by the
              <STRONG>receiver</STRONG>, when it wishes to abort  receiving  data.
              The  <STRONG>sender</STRONG>  has  to reply by stop sending data and
              finally indicating end of audio data.

       <STRONG>DLE</STRONG> (0x10)
              a single byte with value 0x10 in the data stream.

       <STRONG>0</STRONG>      Touch-tone "0" received. Valid  only  in  direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>1</STRONG>      Touch-tone  "1"  received.  Valid only in direction

              from emulator to application.
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>5</STRONG>      Touch-tone  "5"  received.  Valid only in direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>6</STRONG>      Touch-tone "6" received. Valid  only  in  direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>7</STRONG>      Touch-tone  "7"  received.  Valid only in direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>8</STRONG>      Touch-tone "8" received. Valid  only  in  direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>9</STRONG>      Touch-tone  "9"  received.  Valid only in direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>#</STRONG>      Touch-tone "#" received. Valid  only  in  direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>*</STRONG>      Touch-tone  "*"  received.  Valid only in direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>A</STRONG>      Touch-tone "A" received. Valid  only  in  direction

       <STRONG>B</STRONG>      Touch-tone  "B"  received.  Valid only in direction
              from emulator to application.

       <STRONG>C</STRONG>      Touch-tone "C" received. Valid  only  in  direction
              from emulator to application.
